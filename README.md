# The Meta-Stack of Activities for Training Computer Science Teachers

When developing [Stack](https://github.com/teaching-lab/stack-cs-activities), the collection of activities for teaching computer science, we realized that we have some material that does not teach CS itself, but instead, can be used in CS teacher training. That's why we created the Meta-Stack: an open-source collection of activities for teacher training in the domain of CS.

Each activity in the Meta-Stack features a thorough description, printable handouts, and supporting materials that can be easily used in teacher training sessions. For free.

## Activities

* [Code review](activities/code-review) -- The students formatively assess program code.
