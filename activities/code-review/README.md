# Code review

The students review program code. They then share their reviews and discuss properties of good formative feedback.

## Learning outcomes

* Providing formative feedback on program code.

## Setup and preparation

* Print the [task](activities/code-review/code/task.pdf) N/2 times, where N is the number of students.
* Print the four sample solutions: [1](activities/code-review/code/code1.pdf), [2](activities/code-review/code/code2.pdf), [3](activities/code-review/code/code3.pdf), and [4](activities/code-review/code/code4.pdf), each approximately N/4 times.
* Side note: The PDFs were generated from the Python source code using [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/). The following settings were used:
	* Theme: One Light
	* Background: white
	* Turn off width auto-adjustment
	* Advanced: Drop shadopw offset-y: beginning of D, Drop shadow blur radius: after a

## Activity overview

* Have students make pairs.
* Each pair receives the task and two solutions so that all four solutions are evenly distributed among the students. (Each solution should be reviewed by at least two pairs in the classroom.)
* The pair assesses the two solutions. If a pair is too fast, they may receive an additional solution.
* Display the first solution on the projector. All pairs who reviewed this solution share their comments. Each consecutive pair shares only additional comment, i.e., they do not need to repeat what was said previously. With each comment, discuss whether it is formative.
* Continue similarly with the second, third, and fourth solution.

## Tips and tricks

* The students often only list the mistakes in the code. Have them go one step further to provide constructive, formative feedback on the code.
* Remind the students that formative feedback should include also positive aspects apart from naming the mistakes.
* If you have enough time, you can snowball the pairs and let them exchange their solutions.

## Related material

* There are excellent chapters on formative and summative assessment in Geoff Petty's book [Teaching Today](http://geoffpetty.com/geoffs-books/teaching-today/).
